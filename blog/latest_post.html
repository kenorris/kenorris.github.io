      <h2>Option to Test</h2>
      <h4> August 1, 2015</h4>
       <p> Hundreds of kids stream into the two open doors of Novi High School at 7 a.m. armed with 3 No. 2 pencils and an approved calculator. Through the main hallway and up the stairs, the kids started to disperse, each going to his/her assigned classroom by last name. This same ritual is being happening at the same time in Algona High School in Algona, Iowa, The Sharon Academy in Sharon, Virginia and countless other locations throughout the U.S. This particular Saturday is, of course, ACT test day.</p>

<p>Six times a year students gather in a high school or another community space for hours to scribble in bubbled letters and prove their testing abilities. These six hours of testing, meant to capture the essence of that student’s educational history, play a significant part of any student’s admission to college. Or at least they used to.</p>

<p>George Washington University will become one of the largest universities in the United States to not require ACT or SAT standardized test scores, effective August 1.  The University doesn’t want students to be discouraged from applying to the school if their test scores aren’t as high as the University’s standard, according to GW’s website.</p>

<p>George Washington is not the first university to take a ‘test-optional’ approach but it is definitely the most prominent and it raises the question, will more schools follow in its footsteps?</p>

<p>As a rising Northwestern University sophomore, I am more than familiar with the ACT test and done with it forever. From my first test at the beginning of my sophomore year, to the last the summer before senior year, I spent countless hours studying, learning and preparing. I walked into Novi High School five separate Saturday mornings over the course of those two years. I (my parents) spent money on prep books, test strategy apps and test fees to get me into my dream university.</p>

<p>And it worked, but what if Northwestern was ‘test-optional.’ I think I wouldn’t have changed much about my behavior. My brother and sister both took the test several times before me and it was just my expectation that I would do the same. I didn’t even hate taking the ACT; waking up in the morning was bad but the test itself was almost a game to me- I just kept trying to beat my own high score.</p>

<p>But many of my friends didn’t see the test in the same light as I and they struggled; its not that they were dumb (many had better GPAs than myself) but they weren't good test takers. The policy George Washington University has changed to is something many other schools should adopt. Standardized tests measure the student’s test-taking ability rather than intellect and competence at a university. A high school GPA is a better assessment of a student over a length of time rather just a few hours.</p>

<p>My score represented me well; it complimented my GPA and essays. But for thousands of students worldwide, the score is a negative (sometimes the only negative) on their college applications. It doesn’t represent their hard work or ability in slightest bit.</p>

<p>The ACT and SAT are not ‘evil’ tests; they just are made for a certain type of student. But it is important for universities to recognize that these tests are not the end-all-be-all. George Washington took a monumental step this week in recognizing this.</p>
