      <h3> Several student groups gathered April 23 for the annual Take Back the Night march to raise awareness about sexual violence. 

<em>Script</em> <br>
Marching up Sheridan, students carried banners and shouted chants to show support for sexual assault survivors.
Take Back the Night was a part of an international movement to educate people about the issue.<br>

Freshman Hannah Johnson helped plan the march and other events during the week.<br>

"This was my first take bake the night since I'm a freshman," Johnson said. "But we got so much support at every event, especially the march was just an amazing experience."<br>

The march started at the rock.
Careâ€™s coordinator of sexual violence response services about services at northwestern and how students can come together to put an end to sexual assault. <br>

Students then marched together with banners through the arch, up Sheridan and ended on the steps of Norris. <br>

"It was really loud and exciting and we definitely got the attention of people on the road which was good," Johnson said.<br>

Sophomore Alyse slaughter participated in the event.<br>

"There were a lot more people than I expected that came out which was really good to see," Slaughter said. "There were a lot of guys which was cool and there was a real sense of solidarity."<br>

Wachter said that 1 in 4 women are victims of rape or attempted rape, a number which <em>rises</em> to 1 in 3 women on college campuses. <br>

"It is an important issue for everyone but especially college students because on a campus we are more vulnerable for these events to happen to us," Johnson said.
