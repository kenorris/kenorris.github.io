Panera Cares Community Café in Chicago operated in Lakeview on a pay-what-you-can model allowing customers to pay a suggested donation amount if possible, for three and a half years until last January when doors closed for good, leaving a struggling community behind. </p>
<p class="article">
“The Panera Bread Foundation and the team at the Panera Cares Community Cafe in Chicago were humbled by the support we received,” a press release stated after the closing. “That said, our lease at this site was expiring and the Foundation decided that it did not make sense to renew it due to changing economics. It was not a sensible option for the Foundation.”</p>
<p class="article">
Panera Cares Community Cafes operate in four other U.S. cities and are sponsored by the Panera Bread Foundation. Panera was among the first organizations to open a nonprofit café in 2009 but the business model has been on the rise. </p>
<p class="article">
In the past six years, four new nonprofit cafes have opened in the Chicago metro area. </p>
<p class="article">
In a four-year attempt to start a nonprofit café, a group of Englewood residents encountered community support, property problems, and many other tests. Opening in 2013, Kusanya Café aims to be a community gathering place, for a good cause. </p>
<p class="article">
“There’s millions of challenges, starting just with commercial space,” Executive Director Phil Sipka said. “It took us a couple years to find somewhere because the building infrastructure in Englewood has just been devastated.”</p>
<p class="article">
It was important to the founders to have the café in Englewood because the profits would go back into the neighborhood to plan events such as free yoga sessions, art symposiums and meals for the homeless, Sipka said. </p>
<p class="article">
The group also had difficulties filing the correct IRS forms. Kusanya Café is unique because it is self-sustaining, it doesn’t rely on a large organization or donations but simply the profits from the café sales. </p>
<p class="article">
“What we always had was community support right from the get-go and I think that’s because everyone involved lived in the neighborhood,’ Sipka said. “That’s one thing we are really proud of, it came from the neighborhood.” </p>
<p class="article">
Curt’s Café in Evanston also works with community members by providing jobs and training to at-risk teens who need to turn their lives around, area manager Karen Smith said. </p>
<p class="article">
“We meet [the students] where they are, everyone has different needs and we try to move them forward from there,” Smith said. “The first thirty days [with a new student] the challenge is getting them to trust us and know that we are really here to help them.”</p>
<p class="article">
While working with the employees to be responsible and dependable is the main challenge Curt’s Café runs into, it is an essential transition for the teens, Smith said. </p>
<p class="article">
Inspiration Kitchens in Uptown Chicago, a café ran by previously homeless or incarcerated students of a 13-week foodservice training program encounters complications with state funding and more.</p>
<p class="article">
“It’s no secret right now that funding from government sources is going through a very tumultuous period,” Chief Development Officer Evan Cauble-Johnson said. “but the biggest challenge that we face is the challenge that our participants are struggling to overcome serious obstacles to exiting poverty and having a more stable, self-sufficient lifestyle, and that’s our challenge as well.”</p>
<p class="article">
Despite these challenges, Kusanya Café, Curt’s Café and Inspiration Kitchens all report good business and don’t plan following in Panera’s path to closed doors.</p>
<p class="article">
“This space really gives you the ability to connect with people and actually become friends with people and share stories,” Cauble-Johnson said. “You gain a greater understanding of how different people’s lives are and that’s a huge benefit.”
