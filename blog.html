      <h2>Hey there, I'm Kelly Norris</h2>
       <p> I am a journalism student at Northwestern University and interning at the University of Michigan Communications this summer. My hope is to inspire you, entertain you and provoke you to think about the world and society we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been interested in journalism since I was in 8th grade (see Kelly circa 2009) and have been as involved as possible in the news reporting from that time. Follow my posts to stay up to date on my life at college, my thoughts on current events and other random tidbits. Feel free to check out my full <a href="https://kenorris.github.io/index" target="_blank">personal website</a> or <a a href="mailto:kellynnorris2018@u.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">contact me</a> with any comments, questions, etc.
