        <p class="article">
Senior Makya Morgan has been in six foster homes and three high schools in four years. She started at Mumford High School, then Walled Lake Western for two years and she will graduate from Novi after spending her senior year here.</p>
 <p class="article">
“When I was four my dad died. He got shot. I only know him from pictures and videos,” Morgan said. “My mom went schizophrenic and is now homeless.”</p>
 <p class="article">
Once they were without parents, Morgan and her four sisters were put in her Grandmother’s house, where she said they were abused. The girls were then put in foster care.</p>
 <p class="article">
“It’s been movement and movement,” Morgan said. “Me and two of my sisters were old enough and put in a girls home. My younger sisters, they are twins, and they got put in an actual foster home. Eventually, the three of us in the girls home transferred to foster homes.”</p>
<p class="article"> 
The girls have been through several different homes and split apart many times. Between fighting, getting kicked out, abuse and moving, Morgan is now living separately from her sisters. Morgan originally moved to Novi with one foster family, but eventually moved in with senior Carla Gibson and her mother.</p>
<p class="article">
“Makya said she needed a new place to live because her current home just wasn’t the right fit,” Gibson said.</p>
<p class="article">
The two girls had meet at the beginning of the year in the locker room.</p>
<p class="article">
“One of us had dance, the other gym and we just started talking and having conversations,” Gibson said. “We hung out and she slept over at my house a few times, when she said needed somewhere, I offered.”</p>
<p class="article">
Once Morgan decided to move in with the Gibsons, they had to wait for several warrants and paperwork. Officials had to inspect the Gibsons’ home to make sure Morgan had a place to live and sleep.</p>
 <p class="article">
“Technically, I am emancipated now, which means that I take care of myself,” Morgan said. “The government gives me money to help pay for my health, clothes and all that stuff. So basically, I have a land lord.”</p>
 <p class="article">
Because Morgan is completely responsible for herself, she had to pay for all her senior activities by herself including senior picnic, pictures and all night party.</p>
 <p class="article">
“You don’t really learn something until you’ve done it yourself and have to pay for it,” Morgan said.</p>
<p class="article"> 
Morgan has also had to pay for any activities she has been a part of this year. Morgan was involved in National Honor Society at Walled Lake Western which transferred when she moved here. She also became involved in Color Guard for the first time this year.</p>
<p class="article"> 
Along with her extracurricular activities, Morgan worked at McDonald’s and Sonic; Now she makes sandwiches at Penn Station.</p>
<p class="article"> 
“I’ve always had a job since I started [foster] care basically,” Morgan said. “You have to learn things on your own like how to open a bank account and stuff. You have basic help from this program, but they just tell you common sense.”</p>
 <p class="article"> 
Despite her unique path through high school, Morgan will be attending Tennessee State University next year.</p>
 <p class="article">
Western Michigan University gives foster care children full ride scholarships, so Morgan was originally planning to go there, but after moving to Novi was inspired to go somewhere else.</p>
 <p class="article">
“I was taught to go to Western all my life. It was imprinted in my head from my social worker, foster parents and everybody. Eventually, when I moved to the house I am now, the mom is a nurse and told me I could do whatever I wanted and I didn’t need to stay in Michigan,” Morgan said. “If I stay in Michigan, I get more help but I don’t want that to limit me.”</p>
 <p class="article">
Morgan plans on studying in the medical field at TSU and becoming an obstetrician / gynecologist or a surgeon.
